## Make change Project

This project simulates a cash register. The program will calculate the change returned by largest denomination. For example: 
The price of the item is $12.46
The amount paid is $50.00
Then the cash register breaks down each denomination.
* 1 twenty dollar bill
* 1 ten dollar bill
* 1 five dollar bill
* 2 dollar bills
* 2 quarters
* 4 pennies

If there is more then 1 denomination then it is plural.
